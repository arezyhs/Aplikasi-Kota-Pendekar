# Normalize line endings across the repository
# Treat all files as text and let Git handle normalization. On checkout,
# files will use the client OS native line endings unless overridden.
* text=auto

# Force .gitattributes itself and .gitignore to use CRLF on Windows checkouts
# (useful for editors on Windows). If you prefer LF in the working copy,
# change "eol=crlf" to "eol=lf" or remove these lines.
.gitattributes text eol=crlf
.gitignore text eol=crlf

# Ensure common script files keep LF (useful for POSIX shells)
# Uncomment or extend as needed for your repo.
